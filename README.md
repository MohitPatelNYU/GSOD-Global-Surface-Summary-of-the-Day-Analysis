# GSOD-Global-Surface-Summary-of-the-Day-Analysis
Weather Data Analysis:-
 The Source code is just the python file. In order to execute the program you will need to run it on Pyspark notebook or on NYU Hpc Dumbo cluster.
 The data set for this project is too big to attach with the file so the data can be found at
: - https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/gsod
 We have only taken data of the last decade (2008-2018). So if you want to get that data, you will have to run a query on Kaggle kernel and download the dataset.
 The query and the program for extraction is there in the report.
